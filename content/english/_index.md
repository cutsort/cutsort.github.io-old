# Bio

Frederick Tan is on the Bioinformatics Research Faculty at [Carnegie Institution, Department of Embryology](https://emb.carnegiescience.edu), and an Adjunct Assistant Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University, [Department of Biology](https://bio.jhu.edu).  His group conducts research on best practices to train and support diverse populations.  We are interested in strategies that increase persistence among learners, including undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty.  Through our collaborative educational programs, we aim to build inclusive genomic data science communities that advance research using the latest genomic technologies.

<!--
This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
